In brief, here is a general guideline for placing common layout elements in HTML:

- `<header>`: Typically placed at the top of the page or above the main content, it contains introductory content or a site-wide header like a logo or navigation menu.

- `<nav>`: Often placed within the `<header>` element or as a separate section, it contains navigation menus or links to different parts of the website.

- `<main>`: Represents the main content of the HTML document and should not be nested within other structural elements. It contains the primary content unique to each page.

- `<footer>`: Usually placed at the bottom of the HTML document, it contains information like copyright notices, contact details, or related page links.

- `<aside>`: Used for tangentially related content, such as sidebars or supplementary information. It can be positioned alongside the main content or within it.

Remember that these guidelines may vary based on the specific design and requirements of the website, and CSS can be used to further customize the layout and positioning of these elements.
