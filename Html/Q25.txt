Explain the concept of web storage in HTML5. What are the different types of storage and when to use what?

Web Storage in HTML5 provides client-side storage options for web applications: localStorage and sessionStorage.

- localStorage:
  - Persistent storage across multiple sessions.
  - Data remains even after browser closure.
  - Larger storage capacity (around 5MB or more).
  - Suitable for long-term data and user preferences.

- sessionStorage:
  - Data tied to a specific browsing session.
  - Cleared when the browser or tab is closed.
  - Temporary storage solution.
  - Ideal for session-specific data and temporary needs.

Both use key-value pairs and JavaScript APIs for interaction. Web storage enhances web applications by offering efficient client-side data storage without relying solely on server-side solutions.
