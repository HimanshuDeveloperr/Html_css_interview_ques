In short, CSS specificity determines which styles are applied to an element when there are conflicting styles targeting it. It is calculated based on the selectors used, and higher specificity takes precedence. The order of importance is: inline styles, ID selectors, class selectors, attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and element selectors. Inline styles have the highest specificity, and styles defined later in the CSS file override earlier ones with the same specificity. Understanding specificity helps manage styles effectively and avoid conflicts.
