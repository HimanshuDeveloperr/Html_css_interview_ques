Why do you think the addition of drag-and-drop functionality in HTML5 is important? How will you make an image draggable in HTML5?

The addition of drag-and-drop functionality in HTML5 is important as it enhances user experience by enabling intuitive and interactive interactions with web content. It simplifies tasks, improves usability, and enables streamlined workflows.

To make an image draggable in HTML5:

1. Assign an `id` to the `<img>` tag representing the image.
2. Use JavaScript to add a `dragstart` event listener to the image.
3. In the event listener, set the data to be transferred during the drag operation using `event.dataTransfer.setData()`.
4. Optionally, apply CSS styles to indicate the draggable nature of the image.

With these steps, the image becomes draggable, allowing users to click and hold it to initiate the drag operation. Further customization and handling of events like `dragenter`, `dragover`, and `drop` can be implemented to define behavior when dragging over or dropping onto specific areas.
