What are forms and how to create forms in HTML? 

The HTML form is used to collect the user inputs. HTML provides a <form> tag to create forms.
To take input from the user we use the <input> tag inside the form so that all collected user data can be sent to the server for processing
There are different input types like ‘button’, ‘checkbox’, ‘number’, ‘text’, ‘password’, ‘submit’ etc.
